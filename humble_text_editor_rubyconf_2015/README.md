# String Theory & Time Travel: The Humble Text Editor
*This talk was given at RubyConf 2015.*

- [humble\_text\_editor.pdf](humble\_text\_editor.pdf) has all of the slides with some of the animations expanded into individual pages.
- [text\_editor\_talk.key.zip](text\_editor\_talk.key.zip) has the original Keynote file.
- [history\_example](history\_example) has an expanded version of the simple branched history implementation shown in the presentation.
  - [demo.rb](history\_example/demo.rb) shows examples of the Editor class working with the History and Buffer classes to provide a working branched undo history.

I will be uploading more examples in the coming weeks.

As soon as it is more ready I will upload the text editor that I have been working on and link to it from here.
