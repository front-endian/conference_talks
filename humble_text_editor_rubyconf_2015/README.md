# String Theory & Time Travel: The Humble Text Editor
*This talk was given at RubyConf 2015*.

- /humble\_text\_editor.pdf has all of the slides with some of the animations expanded into individual pages
- /text\_editor\_talk.key.zip has the original Keynote file
- /history\_example/ has an expanded version of the simple branched history implementation shown in the presentation
  - /history\_example/demo.rb shows everything working

I will be uploading more examples in the coming weeks.

As soon as it is more ready I will upload the text editor that I have been working on and link to it from here.
