# Running Ruby On The Apple ][

- [See the slides here](https://github.com/justcolin/conference_talks/blob/master/ruby_on_the_apple_ii__rubykaigi_2019/slides.pdf).
- Additional notes explaining the slides can be found in the [source code for the presentation](https://github.com/justcolin/conference_talks/blob/master/ruby_on_the_apple_ii__rubykaigi_2019/src/nruby_slides.s).
- You can run this [disk image with the compiled presentation](https://github.com/justcolin/conference_talks/blob/master/ruby_on_the_apple_ii__rubykaigi_2019/SLIDES.DSK) on most Apple II emulators.
- The presentation was made using an Apple II presentation tool I wrote. You can find the [presentation tool source code here](https://github.com/justcolin/fruity_asm_presenter). It is filled with comments if you want to see what a simple 6502 assembly program looks like.
